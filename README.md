# Media Center Application

## Abstract
The media center that was developed for this project is comprised of several subsystems which utilize the MCB1700 boards instruments. The center's features are a photo gallery, an MP3 player that plays audio from the PC, and a game center for flappy bird and tic tac toe. Each of these features use the LCD for the user interface and joystick for navigation. This media center was designed and implemented using the concepts that were studied and practiced regarding embedded system design.
